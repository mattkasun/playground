# Cash Tracker

I use [GNU Cash](www.gnucash.org) to track my personal finances but I needed something 
to keep track of cash spending between data entry sessions.  I tried a number of mobile
apps but, in no particular order
+ ads
+ cost for pro versions
+ sync between multiple devices (tablet, phone, laptop)  

so I decided to create this app.  It serves my purposes  
note => not intended for multiple simultaneous access.



check out [demo](https://demo.nusak.ca) running on [Digital Ocean](https://m.do.co/c/7ecc5675b40b)
